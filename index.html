                <p>
                    Happy Birthday, my beautiful love.<br><br>

                    You are not just my girlfriend; you are the **only one** I talk to, my deepest comfort in the midst of chaos, and truly, the only reason I smile these days. You are my rest after every long day. I built this small space, clean and white like your favourite color, just to tell you what you mean to me.<br><br>

                    When I feel lost, you are my steady anchor. When the world is too loud, you are my silence. Thank you for being my safe space, my best duo partner, and the one person I can trust completely. I know you're romantic only to me, and that's the greatest gift I could ask for.<br><br>

                    Every day spent with you is a victory. I love your focus, your studious drive, and even your passion for cricket—but most of all, I love the beautiful soul you share only with me.<br><br>

                    I love you more than words can say, and my world is 100% better because you are in it. This Saturday is all about celebrating you. I can't wait for our date on the 15th, but first, let's celebrate your day!<br><br>

                    Happy Birthday, my whole world.
